description: Session Guard 2.0 procedures - task work, hand-off, break hand-off and "finish session". Use when a "[Session Guard]" instruction says HAND-OFF, BREAK RULE, FINISH SESSION, TARGET STOP, NO WORK or 700k, when the user writes "finish session", or when the user asks for a hand-off.

# Session Guard 2.0

`sg` = the command given at session start (`python "<plugin>/scripts/session_guard.py"`). Your SESSION-ID is in
`$SG_SESSION_ID` (else pass `--session <id>`). Numbers come only from "[Session Guard]" lines; never estimate.

## Task work
- `sg task list` · `sg task show <id>` · `sg task claim <id>` (a task another active session owns: ask the user;
  with their yes `--takeover "<their words>"`).
- New main task only with the user's approval: `sg task new --title "..." --approval "<their words>"`; subtask:
  `--parent <id>` (no approval). Unrelated work: `sg idea add "..."`.
- After each step: `sg task note <id> --done "..." --pending "..."`; finished: `sg task done <id>` at once.
- Redo or extend a finished task: `sg task reopen <id> --title "..." --relation reopens|extends --approval "..."`.
- Never edit the task block of docs/STATUS.md or `.claude/session-guard2/`; free notes go under "## Notes".

## Hand-off (300k, 800k, finish, break, or on request)
Only on a Session Guard instruction or the user's request (250k is a notice only).
1. For each open task you own (the instruction lists them): `sg handoff write <id> --technical "<files,
   commands, where it stopped, what to check first>"` (optional `--done`, `--pending`, `--pr <url>`). Branch and
   PR are filled in when found. A finished task needs none; an unchanged hand-off is not written again.
2. `sg handoff publish`: commits only Session Guard's files and verifies the push. "NOT VERIFIED" means the
   hand-off is not done: tell the user why in one line (no remote, push rejected, ...).
3. Tell the user in one line: hand-off ready (task ids), continue in a new session. When a new session claims
   the task, this session is locked.

## Break hand-off (BREAK RULE)
Do not run the user's command; no reading or research for it. Session Guard already stored it word for word in
each task you own. Do "Hand-off", tell the user to continue in a new session.

## Finish session
Do nothing else the message asks. 1. "Hand-off". 2. Run the `--report` command from the instruction; read the
weekly and 5-hour quota with the usage tool if there is one; add one row to "Session measurements" in
docs/STATUS_ARCHIVE.md ("n/a" for a value you cannot read; never invent one). 3. Tell the user: session closed.
